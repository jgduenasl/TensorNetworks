The goal of this project is to implement tensor networks to describe physical systems. The first step is learn the 
properties of the Matrix Product States (MPS) to recast high-dimensional tensors representing physical quantities. The 
second step is implement an pwn implementation of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm in python using
the Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow and Tensornewtwork libraries.
 
We based on the work developed by Professor Glen Evenbly, his tutorials shown in the website [Tensors.net](https://www.tensors.net/)
and his course [Introduction to the MERA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1KVkz19riE).
