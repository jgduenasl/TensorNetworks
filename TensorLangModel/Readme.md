1. The import/ directory contains the raw data, the cleaning and wrangling preparation of data and a suitable files 
to perform analysis.
2. The model/ directory code for the language representation of the corpus and the tensor representation for sentences. 
Adittionaly, we validate the results with respect to Recurrent Neural Networks.
3. The output/ directory contains the results of running the model and plot of validation tests.
4. The write/ directory combines the estimates and graphs in an RMarkdown document.
